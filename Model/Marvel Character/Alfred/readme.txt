==== ALFRED PENNYWORTH for MMD (PMX Download) ====

Model converted to MMD format from ArmachamCorp's XPS ported model ( http://fav.me/d6rx7h4 ).
Original model comes from Batman Arkham Origins game, by Warner Bros Games.
This MMD model has a complete and working skeleton, a basic set of facial expression (facial bones based) and a basic set of physics for arms, head, neck and legs. Also it has working IK legs chains. 
Additional bones: Mother, Groove, Hand "magic bones" (control fingers all together), Hand attachment bones (for accessories).
Finally, it has a morph to hide/show hair
No physics on hair (very short).
Basic textures, with no toon nor spa/sph textures.
